# PerformanceEstimation

This organization regroups works/packages/toolboxes related to performance estimation problems.

If you find some content useful, please don't hesitate to give feedbacks and or to star the content!

## Current packages
- [**PESTO**](https://github.com/PerformanceEstimation/Performance-Estimation-Toolbox): allows a quick access to performance estimation problems in Matlab.
- [**PEPit**](https://github.com/PerformanceEstimation/PEPit): allows a quick access to performance estimation problems in Python.

There are also related works on using performance estimation problems for finding Lyapunov (or potential, or energy) functions. Those techniques were not included in PESTO and PEPit yet (for structural reasons), which currently only allow to study pre-defined Lyapunov functions (as opposed to find them). Two of those works provide easy-to-use interfaces:
- [linear convergence for smooth strongly convex problems](https://github.com/AdrienTaylor/quad-lyap-first-order),
- [linear and sublinear convergence for splitting algorithms](https://github.com/ManuUpadhyaya/tight_lyapunov_analysis).


## Education

- Practical exercises: [**here**](https://github.com/PerformanceEstimation/Learning-Performance-Estimation).


## Events

If you organize a PEP-event, we would be happy to list your event below. 

Past events: 
- February 2023: [**PEP-talks**](https://performanceestimation.github.io/PEP-talks/february_2023/).


## Contributing

If you have any feedback or other input, please don't hesitate to contribute by sharing it. We are happy to review any constructive pull request. In particular, if you find any example of application that you find relevant, don't hesitate to submit it as a new example within one of the toolboxes and/or to the [**learning performance estimation problems**](https://github.com/PerformanceEstimation/Learning-Performance-Estimation) repository.
